# Machine Learning Foundations

This repo is home to the code that accompanies Jon Krohn's *Machine Learning Foundations* curriculum, which provides a comprehensive overview of all of the subjects — across mathematics, statistics, and computer science — that underlie contemporary machine learning approaches, including deep learning and other artificial intelligence techniques.

There are eight subjects in the curriculum, organized into four subject areas. 
* **Linear Algebra**
   * 1: [Intro to Linear Algebra](https://github.com/KhushiBhadange/Machine-Learning-Foundation/blob/master/notebooks/1-intro-to-linear-algebra.ipynb)
   * 2: [Linear Algebra II: Matrix Operations](https://github.com/KhushiBhadange/Machine-Learning-Foundation/blob/master/notebooks/2-linear-algebra-ii.ipynb)
* **Calculus**
   * 3: [Calculus I: Limits & Derivatives](https://github.com/KhushiBhadange/Machine-Learning-Foundation/blob/master/notebooks/3-calculus-i.ipynb)
   * 4: [Calculus II: Partial Derivatives & Integrals](https://github.com/KhushiBhadange/Machine-Learning-Foundation/blob/master/notebooks/4-calculus-ii.ipynb)
* **Probability and Statistics**
   * 5: [Probability & Information Theory](https://github.com/KhushiBhadange/Machine-Learning-Foundation/blob/master/notebooks/5-probability.ipynb)
   * 6: [Intro to Statistics](https://github.com/KhushiBhadange/Machine-Learning-Foundation/blob/master/notebooks/6-statistics.ipynb)
* **Computer Science**
   * 7: [Algorithms & Data Structures](https://github.com/KhushiBhadange/Machine-Learning-Foundation/blob/master/notebooks/7-algos-and-data-structures.ipynb)
   * 8: [Optimization](https://github.com/KhushiBhadange/Machine-Learning-Foundation/blob/master/notebooks/8-optimization.ipynb)
   
Later subjects build upon content from earlier subjects, so the recommended approach is to progress through the eight subjects in the order provided. That said, you're welcome to pick and choose individual subjects based on your interest or existing familiarity with the material. In particular, each of the four subject areas are fairly independent so could be approached separately.
