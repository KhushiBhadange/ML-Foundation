# Machine Learning Foundations

This repo is home to the code that accompanies Jon Krohn's *Machine Learning Foundations* curriculum, which provides a comprehensive overview of all of the subjects — across mathematics, statistics, and computer science — that underlie contemporary machine learning approaches, including deep learning and other artificial intelligence techniques.

There are eight subjects in the curriculum, organized into four subject areas. 
* **Linear Algebra**
   * 1: [Intro to Linear Algebra](https://github.com/KhushiBhadange/Machine-Learning-Foundation/blob/master/notebooks/1-intro-to-linear-algebra.ipynb)
   * 2: [Linear Algebra II: Matrix Operations](https://github.com/KhushiBhadange/Machine-Learning-Foundation/blob/master/notebooks/2-linear-algebra-ii.ipynb)
* **Calculus**
   * 3: [Calculus I: Limits & Derivatives](https://github.com/KhushiBhadange/Machine-Learning-Foundation/blob/master/notebooks/3-calculus-i.ipynb)
   * 4: [Calculus II: Partial Derivatives & Integrals](https://github.com/KhushiBhadange/Machine-Learning-Foundation/blob/master/notebooks/4-calculus-ii.ipynb)
* **Probability and Statistics**
   * 5: [Probability & Information Theory](https://github.com/KhushiBhadange/Machine-Learning-Foundation/blob/master/notebooks/5-probability.ipynb)
   * 6: [Intro to Statistics](https://github.com/KhushiBhadange/Machine-Learning-Foundation/blob/master/notebooks/6-statistics.ipynb)
* **Computer Science**
   * 7: [Algorithms & Data Structures](https://github.com/KhushiBhadange/Machine-Learning-Foundation/blob/master/notebooks/7-algos-and-data-structures.ipynb)
   * 8: [Optimization](https://github.com/KhushiBhadange/Machine-Learning-Foundation/blob/master/notebooks/8-optimization.ipynb)
   
Later subjects build upon content from earlier subjects, so the recommended approach is to progress through the eight subjects in the order provided. That said, you're welcome to pick and choose individual subjects based on your interest or existing familiarity with the material. In particular, each of the four subject areas are fairly independent so could be approached separately. 


To suit your preferred mode of learning, the content is now available via several channels: 

* **YouTube**
    * Linear Algebra [complete playlist here](https://www.youtube.com/playlist?list=PLRDl2inPrWQW1QSWhBU0ki-jq_uElkh2a) and [detailed blog post here](https://www.jonkrohn.com/posts/2021/5/9/linear-algebra-for-machine-learning-complete-math-course-on-youtube)
    * Calculus [complete playlist here](https://www.youtube.com/playlist?list=PLRDl2inPrWQVu2OvnTvtkRpJ-wz-URMJx)
    * [Probability playlist](https://www.youtube.com/playlist?list=PLRDl2inPrWQWwJ1mh4tCUxlLfZ76C1zge) is in active development (sign up for my email newsletter at [jonkrohn.com](https://www.jonkrohn.com/) to be notified of new video releases)
    * In time, all of the subjects of my ML Foundations curriculum will be freely available on YouTube.
* **O'Reilly** (many employers and educational institutions provide free access to this platform; if you don't have access, you can get a 30-day free trial with the code `SDSPOD23`)
    * [Linear Algebra videos](https://learning.oreilly.com/videos/linear-algebra-for/9780137398119/) published in Dec 2020 ([free hour-long lesson](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uG_wjmuigGg))
    * [Calculus videos](https://learning.oreilly.com/videos/calculus-for-machine/9780137398171/) published in Jan 2021 ([free hour-long lesson](https://youtu.be/ZDAX17OGMAM))
    * [Probability and Stats videos](https://learning.oreilly.com/videos/probability-and-statistics/9780137566273/) published in May 2021 ([free hour-long lesson](https://youtu.be/uJcGj-k50iE))
    * [Computer Science videos](https://learning.oreilly.com/videos/data-structures-algorithms/9780137644889/) published in Jun 2021 ([free hour-long lesson](https://youtu.be/yfKkMdndY-E))
    * (For convenience, this publisher compiled all 28 hours of the above four video series into a single playlist [here](https://learning.oreilly.com/videos/-/9780137903245/).)
* **Udemy**: All the Linear Algebra and Calculus content has been [live in a *Mathematical Foundations of ML* course](https://www.udemy.com/course/machine-learning-data-science-foundations-masterclass/) since Sep 2021 (free overview video [here](https://youtu.be/qhLo19EIA4g)). While this course stands alone as a complete introduction to the math subjects, Subjects 5-8 will eventually be added as free bonus material.
